| **Layered Architecture (N-Tier)**   | System divided into layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access).                       | Web apps, enterprise systems, desktop apps (e.g., banking systems, e-commerce).                       | Easy to maintain, modular, clear separation of concerns.                                    | Rigidity, performance overhead, can lead to tight coupling.                                    |
| **Monolithic**                      | All components tightly coupled into a single codebase. A single, unified application structure.     | Small projects, simple web apps, MVPs.                                                                  | Easy to develop, test & deploy, low latency.                                                 | Hard to scale, inflexible to changes, single point of failure.                                |
| **Modular Monolithic**              | A monolithic system divided into modules or components, but still within a single codebase.         | Small-to-medium-sized projects, web apps, enterprise apps.                                             | Easier to maintain than traditional monolithic, still benefits from a unified codebase.     | Limited scalability, complex dependencies, challenging to split into microservices later.     |
| **Microservices**                   | System decomposed into small, independent services with bounded contexts.                           | Scalable, complex systems, Large-scale, cloud-based applications (e.g., Amazon, Spotify, Netflix, Uber). | Scalable, fault-tolerant, independent deployments.                                            | Complex management, high operational cost.                                                     |
| **Serverless**                      | Runs on cloud-managed services without server maintenance, Cloud-managed functions triggered by events (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions). | Cloud applications, event-driven workloads. Event-driven tasks, APIs, batch processing.               | Auto-scaling, cost-efficient, no infrastructure management.

| **Client-Server**                   | Clients request services from centralized servers (i.e. Web browser/server).                        | Web apps, email systems, databases, file servers.                                                     | Centralized control, resource sharing, scalable, secure for stateless clients.              | Server downtime affects all clients, potential bottlenecks, limited scalability.               |
