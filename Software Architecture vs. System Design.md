# Software Architecture vs. System Design

**Software Architecture** provides the overarching framework and guidelines for the system, whereas **System Design** dives into the specifics of how each part of the system will be built and function. Both are essential for creating a robust, efficient, and maintainable software system.

## Key Takeaway
- **Architecture**: Defines the structure and principles.  
- **System Design**: Implements the details within that structure.

| **Output**        | Architecture diagrams, design principles                      | Class diagrams, API specs, ER diagrams, pseudocode |
| **Timing**        | Early in the development process                              | After architecture is defined                      |
|                     | Early lifecycle (foundational decisions)                    | Follows architecture (blueprint for coding)        |
| **Change Frequency** | Less frequent                                             | More frequent                                      |
| **Examples**       | Monolithic vs. Microservices, Cloud vs. On-premise           | Database schema, API design, module interactions   |
|                     | Choosing microservices vs. monolithic architecture         | Designing database schemas or API endpoints        |

## Key Differences in Various Aspects

| **Aspect**          | **Software Architecture**                                     | **System Design**                                   | **Key Differences** |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Scalability**    | Defines scaling strategy (horizontal/vertical), selects architecture type (monolithic/microservices) | Implements tactical scaling (e.g., load balancers, auto-scaling groups, database sharding) | Architecture decides how to scale, System Design enables it. |
| **Performance**    | Sets performance goals, selects high-performance technologies (e.g., in-memory databases) | Optimizes performance through code, database queries, and network configurations | Architecture defines what performance means, System Design achieves it. |
|                     | Sets performance goals (e.g., latency thresholds) and selects high-level patterns (caching layers, CDNs) | Optimizes code, algorithms, and infrastructure (e.g., query indexing, caching strategies like LRU) | |
| **Security**       | Establishes security principles, selects security frameworks (e.g., TLS, encryption standards, compliance frameworks like GDPR) | Implements security features (e.g., token-based auth, encryption, secure sessions, OAuth2, HTTPS, input sanitization, role-based access) | Architecture defines security policies, System Design enforces technical safeguards. |
| **Data Management** | Chooses data storage strategies (SQL vs. NoSQL, replication, partitioning) | Designs database schemas, queries, and data pipelines, implements data migration processes (e.g., ER diagrams, ETL processes, indexing) | Architecture plans where and how data lives, System Design builds how itâ€™s used. |
| **Communication**  | Chooses communication protocols (REST, gRPC, WebSockets, event-driven vs. synchronous), defines interaction patterns | Implements APIs, message formats (JSON/Protobuf), and error-handling mechanisms (retry/error-handling logic) for communication | Architecture selects communication protocols, System Design implements message details. |
